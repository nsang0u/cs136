/*
 * This interface is used to represent a lexicon, or word list. The main
 * difference between the lexicon abstraction and a dictionary is that 
 * the lexicon does not provide any mechanism for storing definitions of
 * words; a string is just either in the list or not.
 * 
 * The lexicon supports lookup of words and prefixes. You can 
 * populate the lexicon by adding words one at a time or by reading word
 * data from a file.  You can also remove words from the lexicon, and
 * write the contents of the lexicon to a file.
 * 
 * Here is sample use of a LexiconTrie object (LexiconTrie implements Lexicon):
 *
 *	LexiconTrie lex = new LexiconTrie();
 *	lex.addWordsFromFile("lexicon.dat"); {
  *	lex.addWord("doughnut");
 *  if (lex.containsPrefix("fru") || lex.containsWord("ball"))
 *		//do something
